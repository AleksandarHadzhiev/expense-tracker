# expense-tracker
An expense tracker application.

## Introduction

This is an expense tracker application, which aims to allow the users to manually and automatically provide expenses. The main goals of the project are two. First is to learn how to build charts in the frontend - using pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Second is to learn how to handle multiprocessing and multithreading in the backend - the backend being a FastAPI (Python) Rest API. 

For this reasons the project will aim to minimize the use of external libraries which might provide support for this tasks - be that better or not.

A secondary goal of this project is to practice and get better at handling the infrastructure - CI/CD, Docker - of a project.

## Branching Strategy

There will be only one branch - `main` - where all the changes and new features will be pushed directly. The aim is to get better at building infrastructure, which allows direct updates with limited human intervention - actual CI/CD :).
